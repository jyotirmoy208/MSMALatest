# MSMALatest
The code accompanies the paper 'Postulating Exoplanetary Habitability via a Novel Anomaly Detection Method', Jyotirmoy Sarkar, Kartik Bhatia, Snehanshu Saha, Margarita Safonova and Santonu Sarkar; accepted in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (I.F: 5.287) https://academic.oup.com/mnras. If you find the code useful, please cite our paper. Additional information about habitability research can be found at http://astrirg.org/.
The repository has multiple python, csv and xlsx files. Anomaly Detector.py is the file which contains the MSMBTAI algorithm code and the MSMVMCA code can also be found in the smae file. A few supporting methods are avialble in the utility.py file. MSMA.py file is internally used by the MSMBTAI algorithm. All the results or outcome of the experiments are available in the csv and xlsx files. The preprocessing logic of the D1 and D2 datasets are avialble in the Preprocessing.py. Code of other algorithms which are applied in
comparison can be found in Other algorithms.py.
